## About Me

I am a computational biologist working at the intersection of single-cell genomics, multi-omics integration, and translational immunology, with a focus on reproductive biology. My work centers on extracting biological meaning from complex datasets and translating those insights into clinically relevant hypotheses.

I currently serve as Director of the Bioinformatics Core at Wayne State University, where I collaborate closely with wet-lab scientists and clinicians to design analyses that are rigorous, interpretable, and reproducible.
