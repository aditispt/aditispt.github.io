## The Problem
Environmental stress contributes to early embryonic loss, yet whether distinct stressors converge on shared developmental programs remained unknown.

## Approach
We integrated bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, and developmental trajectory analysis across multiple environmental stress conditions in embryonic stem cells to identify conserved transcriptional responses.

## Key Findings
- All stressors override naïve stemness, forcing exit from the ground (0th) lineage state  
- Stress responses segregate into two distinct lineage-imbalance trajectories  
- Two pan-stress marker genes robustly predict developmental imbalance independent of stressor identity  

## Impact
- **Scientific Reports**, 2025 — Novel kinetic and developmental transcriptomic pan-stress responses of embryonic stem cells  
- **Birth Defects Research**, 2024 — Single-cell fingerprint of stressed embryonic stem cells  
- **Provisional patent (2025)** — Pan-stress transcriptomic markers for predicting embryonic and trophoblast stress
