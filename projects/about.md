# About Me

I am a computational biologist specializing in single-cell and multi-omics
analysis for reproductive immunology and translational biology.

Currently, I serve as **Director of the Bioinformatics Core at Wayne State University**,
where I lead projects spanning single-cell RNA-seq, spatial omics, and systems immunology.

[Optional: add career timeline here later]
