## Overview
Uterine dendritic cells (uDCs) are rare, tissue-resident immune cells critical for implantation, immune tolerance, and tissue remodeling. Despite their importance, their developmental origins, functional diversity, and cycle-dependent dynamics in the human endometrium have remained poorly defined.

This project provides the **first single-cell–resolved, cycle-wide characterization of normal human uterine dendritic cells**.

---

## The Problem
Dendritic cells constitute less than 2% of endometrial immune cells, making them difficult to study using bulk approaches. Existing studies lacked the resolution to distinguish tissue-resident populations from infiltrating DCs or to map functional specialization across the menstrual cycle.

---

## Approach
- Single-cell RNA sequencing of **55 human endometrial biopsies** across **10 menstrual cycle stages**
- MetaCell and Seurat-based clustering to isolate rare DC populations
- Trajectory and state-transition analysis to infer developmental relationships
- Functional annotation using gene programs and pathway enrichment
- Cross-validation using spatial localization and immunofluorescence

---

## Key Findings
- Identified **multiple transcriptionally and functionally distinct uDC subtypes**
- Discovered a **progenitor-like DC population** maintained within the endometrial niche
- Revealed **cycle-dependent functional specialization**, including:
  - Implantation-associated DC states
  - Antigen-presenting DCs
  - Wound-healing and migratory DCs
- Defined a **developmental continuum** linking progenitor, transitional, and mature DC states

---

## Impact
- **First comprehensive atlas** of normal human uterine dendritic cells
- Establishes a developmental framework for studying implantation failure and infertility
- Provides molecular markers to distinguish tissue-resident vs peripheral DCs
